/*
 * Description as found on blackboard:
 * 2. Write a program that reads a file of numbers of type int and writes all the numbers to another file, 
 * but without any duplicate numbers. 
 * Assume that the numbers in the input file are already ordered from smallest to largest. 
 * After the program is run, the new file will contain all the numbers in the original file, 
 * but no number will appear more than once in the file. 
 * The numbers in the output file should also be sorted from smallest to largest. 
 * Your program should obtain both file names from the user. 
 * Use either a text file or a binary file. 
 * For the text-file version, assume one number per line. 
 * For the binary-file version, use numbers of type int that are written using writeInt.
